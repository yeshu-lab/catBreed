    <h2>Exotic Shorthair</h2>
    <div class="rightbar">
      <h1>HISTORY</h1>
      <p>
        As far as cat breeds go, the Exotic Shorthair, also called Exotic, is fairly new, especially when compared to breeds that have been around for hundreds or thousands of years.
      </p>
      <p>
        Around the 1950s, American Shorthair cat breeders began breeding their cats with Persian cats, in the hopes of getting the silver coat and green eyes of the Persian onto the American Shorthair. To their surprise, they instead ended up with a bunch of shorthaired Persian cats.
      </p>
      <p>
        This new type of cat was further bred with Russian Blues and Burmese cats, in order to get the gene for short hair. The offspring of those cats were then bred back with Persian cats, and the new breed of Exotic Shorthairs was created.

      <tr>

      </tr>
    </table>
   <p></p>
    <h1>BEHAVIOR</h1>
   <p>
    The Exotic Shorthair personality can simply be described as calm and friendly. Due in part to their easy-going nature, these felines acclimate well to apartment or household environments, and they enjoy being around kids and adults. Exotics prefer to have company, so if you have a job that requires you to be out of the house for long hours, your Exotic will be thankful for another animal companion.
   </p>
   <p>
    More energetic than Persians, Exotics enjoy playing simple games, but at the end of the day, they will just want to curl up in your lap—don’t be offended when your cat doesn’t want to cuddle in bed at night, Exotics prefer a cool place for sleeping.
   </p>
   <p>
    These cats are not overly vocal, but they may let out a little purr or chirp on occasion. Although a very friendly cat, many are often hesitant towards strangers, at least at first. After getting to know them for even a short amount of time, most Exotics will warm up to their new friend and even want to play or cuddle on their lap.
   </p>
   <p>
    
   </p>
   <h1>GROOMING</h1>
   <p>
    Unlike Persians, which require a hefty amount of grooming, Exotic Shorthairs only need about one brushing per week. This dramatic decrease in grooming needs is one of the main factors leading people to adopt an Exotic over a Persian. This also leads many to wonder, “Are Exotic Shorthair cats hypoallergenic?” In short, the answer is no, Exotics are not a hypoallergenic cat breed, so if you have cat allergies, this is not the breed for you.
   </p>
   <h1>HEALTH PROBLEMS</h1>
   <p>
    Like any other cat breed, Exotic Shorthairs are also prone to certain health problems.
   </p>
   <p>One of the most common issues among this breed is nasal congestion, which, in turn, can lead to poor respiration. Due to their scrunched-up faces, Exotics have a more difficult time allowing air to flow in and out easily. This, in addition to their thick coat, can cause many to be sensitive to the heat. In order to help keep them cool, it’s beneficial to live in an air-conditioned home, and they appreciate having access to cooler areas, such as hardwood or cement floors.</p>
   <p></p>
   <h1>NUTRITION</h1>
   <p>Your cat's diet and nutrition will depend largely on its age, sex, size, and activity levels. If you're unsure how much or how often to feed your Exotic Shorthair, your veterinarian can help you develop a healthy, balanced diet for him. You can also consult the feeding guides developed by your preferred cat food brand.</p>
   <p>Overfeeding your cat can lead to obesity, which causes a whole host of health issues. Be sure to feed your cat a healthy, balanced diet and give treats in moderation.</p>
