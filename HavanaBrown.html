      <h1>HISTORY</h1>
     
      <p>
        Early breeders, called the “Havanna Group”, wanted to create a brown cat breed. They later were known as the Chestnut Brown Group. They created the breed standards for the Havanna Brown cat breed, as it stands today. They selectively bred a Siamese cat that carried a chocolate gene to a black cat, that carried the same chocolate gene. These breeders were able to produce chocolate colored kittens. Two kittens were sent over to the U.S and were cross-bred with Chocolate and Seal-Point Siamese cats. In 1964, the Havanna Brown was accepted for Championships by the CAT fanciers Association. This is a rare cat breed of medium-size, and tops the list of endangered cats.

    <h1>BEHAVIOR</h1>
   <p>
    Often called “Chocolate Delights,” this delightful cat breed is charming and captivating. The Havana can also be mischievous. The Havana is gentle and curious. This cat breed enjoys playing with his family, and loves to race around the house and climb furniture. It is a graceful and sleek cat that is emotionally in-touch with his human family. These cats are extremely sensitive, and do well with gentle children and family. Interactive cat toys and a game of Fetch will always keep the Havana happy. This cat breed is a quiet cat breed that is usually reserved around strangers. This cat breed does well with positive clicker training. That said, this cat breed loves an active family, and does well living indoors or outdoors, as long as he is well taken of. This cat breed is alert, loyal, intelligent and kind.
   </p>
  
   <h1>GROOMING</h1>
   <p>
    The Havana needs daily grooming to remove shedding or dead hair. Because this breed has a silky, soft coat, grooming is easy. Stainless steel combs help to remove dead hair. Care must be taken when grooming leg hair and body hair to avoid sensitive areas. Some cats have very sensitive areas along their backs, legs, and belly area. Curry brushes help with grooming, and will remove dead hair and debris from your cat’s coat.
   </p>
   <h1>HEALTH PROBLEMS</h1>
   <p>
    The Havana is a very healthy and moderately active cat breed that may be susceptible to the following health conditions:
   </p>
   <p>
    Calcium Oxalate Bladder Stones: Small amounts of calcium oxalate is always present in a cat’s urine. When presented in high amounts, this will pose a problem. Oxalate bladder stones will generally affect one out of two cats in the same household, though both will be eating the same feed. Genetic predisposition may partially contribute to cats being prone to getting bladder stones, although diet and environmental conditions have been considered important contributing factors as well. Consult with your veterinarian for advice.
    Ringworm: This is an infection of the skin, hair, or claws, and is caused by a fungus called dermatophyte. This occurs in 98% of cats. It spreads easily from cats to people. Symptoms include circular, bald patches that scale and have broken hairs in a ring-like fashion. Consult with your veterinarian for advice.
    Skin Disorders: The Havana may be prone to skin disorders. This cat breed is prone to idiopathic seborrhea. This is an inherited skin disorder resulting in the overproduction of an oily substance. This clumps in the cat’s fur, and causes it to smell bad. Symptoms include red and irritated skin with excessive scratching. Consult your veterinarian for advice.
   </p>
   <h1>NUTRITION</h1>
   <p>
    The Havana cat breed will need proper nutrition. That said, a high-quality diet that is appropriate for the specific life stage of the cat is necessary. Protein as an ingredient, needs to come first. Dry cat food is a popular choice because it promotes healthier gums and teeth. Yet wet food is more often recommended by veterinarians because it provides more moisture to cats. Cats don’t drink a lot of water and tend to sometimes get dehydrated. Wet cat food also has its benefits. By choosing a well-known name- brand cat food that has scientific backing, as well as quality control, cat parents can be assured that they are providing a well-balanced diet.
